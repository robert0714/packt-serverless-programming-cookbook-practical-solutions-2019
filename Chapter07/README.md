## Introduction
In this chapter, I will introduce you to some services that can help you to perform analytics and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** on the AWS cloud, such as Amazon KDS, the Amazon **Machine Learning (ML)** service, and the Alexa Skills Kit. KDS is primarily used for building data pipelines for big data applications. We will also look at a basic recipe each for the ML service and the Alexa Skills Kit. To learn more about these services, you can refer to any Packt book on data analytics, ML, and NLP.

You will require the following skill sets to complete the recipes in this chapter:
* Knowledge of how to work on AWS account
* Knowledge of how to configure AWS CLI, as discussed in the [Your first Lambda with AWS CLI](../Chapter01/your-first-lambda-with-aws-cli/) recipe in Chapter 1, [Getting Started with Serverless Computing on AWS](../Chapter01/README.md)
* A basic understanding of data analytics, ML, and NLP concepts
