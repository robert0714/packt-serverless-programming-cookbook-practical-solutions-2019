# Getting Started with Serverless Computing on AWS
## Getting ready
You can set up the parent project inside our parent folder (serverless in my case) by executing the following commands from the command line:

1. Clone our book's Github repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Serverless-Programming-Cookbook.git
   ```
2. Go inside the repository folder, go inside our project-specific parent project, and run mvn clean install:
   ``bash
   cd Serverless-Programming-Cookbook
   cd serverless-cookbook-parent-aws-java
   mvn clean install
   ```
